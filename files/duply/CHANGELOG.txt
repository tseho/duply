###############################################################################
TODO/IDEAS/KNOWN PROBLEMS:
- possibility to restore time frames (incl. deleted files)
  realizable by listing each backup and restore from 
  oldest to the newest, problem: not performant
- search file in all backups function and show available
  versions with backups date (list old avail since 0.6.06)
- edit profile opens conf file in vi 
- implement log-fd interpretation
- add a duplicity option check against the options pending 
  deprecation since 0.5.10 namely --time-separator
                             --short-filenames
                            --old-filenames
- add 'exclude_<command>' list usage e.g. exclude_verify
- featreq 25: a download/install duplicity option
- hint on install software if a piece is missing
- import/export profile from/to .tgz function !!!

- bugfix 104: Duply 2.0 sets wrong archive dir, --name was always 'duply_'

2.0 (27.10.2016)
made this a major version change, as we broke backward compatibility anyway
(see last change in v1.10). got complaints that rightfully pointed out
that should only come w/ a major version change. so, here we go ;)
if your backend stops working w/ this version create a new profile and
export the env vars needed as described in the comments of the conf file
directly above the SOURCE setting.
Changes:
- making sure multi spaces in TARGET survive awk processing
- new env var PROFILE exported to scripts 
- fix 102: expose a unique timestamp variable for pre/post scripts
  actually a featreq. exporting RUN_START nanosec unix timestamp
- fix 101: GPG_AGENT_INFO is 'bogus' (thx Thomas Harning Jr.)
- fix 96: duply cannot handle two consecutive spaces in paths

1.11.3 (29.5.2016)
- fix wrong "WARNING: No running gpg-agent ..." when sign key was not set

1.11.2 (11.2.2016)
- fix "gpg: unsafe" version print out 
- bugfix 91: v1.11 [r47] broke asymmetric encryption when using GPG_KEYS_ENC
- bugfix 90: S3: TARGET_USER/PASS have no effect, added additional 
  documentation about needed env vars to template conf file

1.11.1 (18.12.2015)
- bugfix 89: "Duply has trouble with PYTHON-interpreter" on OSX homebrew
- reverted duply's default PYTHON to 'python'

1.11 (24.11.2015)
- remove obsolete --ssh-askpass routine
- add PYTHON conf var to allow global override of used python interpreter
- enforced usage of "python2" in PATH as default interpreter for internal
  use _and_ to run duplicity (setup.py changed the shebang to the fixed
  path /usr/bin/python until 0.7.05, which we circumvent this way)
- featreq 36: support gpg-connect-agent as a means to detect if an agent is 
  running (thx Thomas Harning Jr.), used gpg-agent for detection though
- quotewrapped run_cmd parameters to protect it from spaces e.g. in TMP path
- key export routine respects gpg-agent usage now

1.10.1 (19.8.2015)
- bugfix 86: Duply+Swift outputs warning
- bugfix 87: Swift fails without BACKEND_URL

1.10 (31.7.2015)
- featreq 37: busybox issues - fix awk, grep version detection,
  fix grep failure because --color=never switch is unsupported
  (thx Thomas Harning Jr. for reporting and helping to debug/fix it)
- bugfix 81: --exclude-globbing-filelist is deprecated since 0.7.03
  (thx Joachim Wiedorn, also for maintaining the debian package)
- implemented base-/dirname as bash functions
- featreq 31 " Support for duplicity Azure backend " - ignored a 
  contributed patch by Scott McKenzie and instead opted for removing almost
  all code that deals with special env vars required by backends.
  adding and modifying these results in too much overhead so i dropped this
  feature. the future alternative for users is to consult the duplicity 
  manpage and add the needed export definitions to the conf file.
  appended a commented example to the template conf below the auth section.

1.9.2 (21.6.2015)
- bugfix: exporting keys with gpg2.1 works now (thx Philip Jocks)

- bugfix: debian Bug#743190 "duply no longer allows restoration without 
   gpg passphrase in conf file"
   GPG_AGENT_INFO env var is now needed to trigger --use-agent
- bugfix: gpg keyenc test routines didn't work if GPG_PW was not set

1.7.1 (30.3.2014)
- bugfix: purge-* commands renamed to purgeFull, purgeIncr due to

  see https://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&
              aid=2864410&group_id=217745&atid=1041147

1.5.1 (21.09.2009) - duply (fka. ftplicity)
- first things first: ftplicity (being able to support all backends since 
  some time) will be called duply (fka. ftplicity) from now on. The addendum
  is for the time being to circumvent confusion.
- bugfix: exit code is 1 (error) not 0 (success), if at least on duplicity 
          command failed
- s3[+http] now supported natively by translating user/pass to access_key/
  secret_key environment variables needed by duplicity s3 boto backend 
- bugfix: additional output lines do not confuse version check anymore
- list command supports now age parameter (patch by stefan on feature 
  request tracker)
- bugfix: option/param pairs are now correctly passed on to duplicity
- bugfix: s3[+http] needs no TARGET_PASS if command is read only

1.5.0.2 (31.07.1009)

          replaced with match/substr command combination (bug report)
          https://sf.net/tracker/?func=detail&atid=1041147&aid=2825388&
          group_id=217745

1.5.0 (01.07.2009)
- removed ftp limitation, all duplicity backends should work now
- bugfix: date for separator failed on openwrt busybox date, added a 
  detecting workaround, milliseconds are not available w/ busybox date

1.4.2.1 (14.05.2009)
- bugfix: free temp space detection failed with lvm, fixed awk parse routine

1.4.2 (22.04.2009)
- gpg keys are now exported as gpgkey.[id].asc , the suffix reflects the
  armored ascii nature, the id helps if the key is switched for some reason
  im/export routines are updated accordingly (import is backward compatible 
  to the old profile/gpgkey files)         
- profile argument is treated as path if it contains slashes 
  (for details see usage)
- non-ftplicity options (all but --preview currently) are now passed 
  on to duplicity 
- removed need for stat in secure_conf, it is ls based now
- added profile folder readable check
- added gpg version & home info output
- awk utility availability is now checked, because it was mandatory already
- tmp space is now checked on writability and space requirement
  test fails on less than 25MB or configured $VOLSIZE, 
  test warns if there is less than two times $VOLSIZE because 
  that's required for --asynchronous-upload option  
- gpg functionality is tested now before executing duplicity 
  test drive contains encryption, decryption, comparison, cleanup
  this is meant to detect non trusted or other gpg errors early
- added possibility of doing symmetric encryption with duplicity
  set GPG_KEY="" or simply comment it out
- added hints in config template on the depreciation of 
  --short-filenames, --time-separator duplicity options

new versioning scheme 1.4.2b => 1.4.2, 
beta b's are replaced by a patch count number e.g. 1.4.2.1 will be assigned
to the first bug fixing version and 1.4.2.2 to the second and so on
also the releases will now have a release date formatted (Day.Month.Year)

1.4.1b1 - bugfix: ftplicity changed filesystem permission of a folder
          named exactly as the profile if existing in executing dir
        - improved plausibility checking of config and profile folder
        - secure_conf only acts if needed and prints a warning now

1.4.1b  - introduce status (duplicity collection-status) command
        - pre/post script output printed always now, not only on errors
        - new config parameter GPG_OPTS to pass gpg options
          added examples & comments to profile template conf
        - reworked separator times, added duration display
        - added --preview switch, to preview generated command lines
        - disabled MAX_AGE, MAX_FULL_BACKUPS, VERBOSITY in generated
          profiles because they have reasonable defaults now if not set

1.4.0b1 - bugfix: incr forces incremental backups on duplicity,
          therefore backup translates to pre_bkp_post now
        - bugfix: new command bkp, which represents duplicity's 
          default action (incr or full if full_if_older matches
          or no earlier backup chain is found)

new versioning scheme 1.4 => 1.4.0, added new minor revision number
this is meant to slow down the rapid version growing but still keep 
versions cleanly separated.
only additional features will raise the new minor revision number. 
all releases start as beta, each bugfix release will raise the beta 
count, usually new features arrive before a version 'ripes' to stable
  
1.4.0b
  1.4b  - added startup info on version, time, selected profile
        - added time output to separation lines
        - introduced: command purge-full implements duplicity's 
          remove-all-but-n-full functionality (patch by unknown),
          uses config variable $MAX_FULL_BACKUPS (default = 1)
        - purge config var $MAX_AGE defaults to 1M (month) now 
        - command full does not execute pre/post anymore
          use batch command pre_full_post if needed 
        - introduced batch mode cmd1_cmd2_etc
          (in turn removed the bvp command)
        - unknown/undefined command issues a warning/error now
        - bugfix: version check works with 0.4.2 and older now

        - introduced bvp (backup, verify, purge)
        - bugfix: removed need for awk gensub, now mawk compatible
  1.3b2 - removed pre/post need executable bit set 
        - profiles now under ~/.ftplicity as folders
        - root can keep profiles in /etc/ftplicity, folder must be
          created by hand, existing profiles must be moved there
        - removed ftplicity in path requirement
        - bugfix: bash < v.3 did not know '=~'
        - bugfix: purge works again 
  1.3   - introduces multiple profiles support
        - modified some script errors/docs
        - reordered gpg key check import routine

        - added error_gpg (adds how to setup gpg key howto)
        - bugfix: duplicity 0.4.4RC4+ parameter syntax changed
        - duplicity_version_check routine introduced
        - added time separator, shortnames, volsize, full_if_older 
          duplicity options to config file (inspired by stevie 
          from http://weareroot.de) 
  1.1.1 - bugfix: encryption reactivated
  1.1   - introduced config directory
  1.0   - first release
